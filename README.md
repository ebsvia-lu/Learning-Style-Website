# Student Hub Web Application
My project will be based on a Student productivity focused website with several features. 
Students will have to create a profile.
It is written in Javascript, HMTL, CSs and C# and makes sure of ASP.NET MVC Pattern
The features are:

1 Calendar- Being able to input lectures, meetings and extra curriculum activities into a Calendar and set notification reminders. This will help Students stay organised with commitments.


2 Calculate your marks - This will involve students inputting their modules information e.g. assignments, tests, exams, coursework etc and its percentage so they can automatically see if they are on task to achieve their desired grade. There will also be tips to help students see before hand what mark they need to achieve in an upcoming test for example.

3 Games - Here the users can play games that will aid their learning, for visual learners they will play memory games, create flash cards and audio record themselves.
