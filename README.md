# Student Hub Web Application
My project will be based on a Student productivity focused website with several features. 
Students will have to create a profile.
The features are:

1 Calendar- Being able to input lectures, meetings and extra curriculum activities into a Calendar and set notification reminders. This will help Students stay organised with commitments.

2 To do list/Goal achieved - A daily to do list where students can input what they plan to do for the day along with coursework deadlines.

3 Calculate your marks (Machine-Learning). This will involve students inputting their modules information e.g. assignments, tests, exams, coursework etc and its percentage so they can automatically see if they are on task to achieve their desired grade. There will also be tips to help students see before hand what mark they need to achieve in an upcoming test for example.

4 Revision - Here the users will be allowed to be as creative and interactive as possible. They will be able to create questions for themselves(quiz) which will have a a random question generator, create mind maps ,queue cards and match the definitions.

5 Notes (Lectures/Class) - A place where students can type up their lecture notes along with saving useful website links and storing pictures from the lectures.
